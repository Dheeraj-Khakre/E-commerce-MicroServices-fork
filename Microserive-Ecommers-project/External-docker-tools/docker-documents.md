# Docker & Docker Compose Guide

## üöÄ Introduction

Docker is a platform that packages applications and all their dependencies into **containers**. These containers are lightweight, portable, and run the same across different environments.

Docker Compose is a tool that lets you define and run **multi-container** Docker applications using a simple YAML file.

## üê≥ Docker Concepts

* **Image** ‚Äì Blueprint/template for containers (includes app code + dependencies).
* **Container** ‚Äì Running instance of an image.
* **Dockerfile** ‚Äì Script with instructions to build an image.
* **Registry** ‚Äì Store for images (e.g., Docker Hub).

## üì¶ Docker Compose Concepts

* **Service** ‚Äì Each container (e.g., app, db, redis) defined in YAML.
* **Network** ‚Äì All services in a compose file share a network and can reach each other by name.
* **Volume** ‚Äì Persistent data storage across container restarts.

## üõ† Example: Spring Boot + MySQL + Kafka + MongoDB + Redis + Zipkin

Below is a sample `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    image: my-springboot-app:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      mysql:
        condition: service_healthy
      kafka:
        condition: service_started
      mongodb:
        condition: service_started
      redis:
        condition: service_started
      zipkin:
        condition: service_started

  mysql:
    image: mysql:8
    environment:
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=appdb
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpw
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "ping", "-h", "localhost"]
      interval: 5s
      retries: 5

  zookeeper:
    image: confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:7.0.1
    environment:
      - ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT=2181
    ports:
      - "2181:2181"

  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.0.1
    environment:
      - KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=zookeeper:2181
      - KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://kafka:9092
      - KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR=1
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
    ports:
      - "9092:9092"

  mongodb:
    image: mongo:5.0
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"

  redis:
    image: redis:7
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"

  zipkin:
    image: openzipkin/zipkin
    ports:
      - "9411:9411"
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the application

```bash
docker compose up
```

### ‚èπ Stop everything

```bash
docker compose down
```

* Docker = container platform
* Docker Compose = multi-container orchestration tool
* You can manage your full app stack with just a few commands!
